# mdns-impl
> A hacky and somewhat to spec implementation/exploration of MDNS/DNS-SD.

`mdns-impl` is, albiet a work-in-progress, parser and bitpacker for MDNS requests and responses as well as a
service browser and publisher. Many, better, crates exist and as such this crate, in its current state, should
not be used. This was purely an exploration of the MDNS/DNS-SD protocols so I can use it better in future projects.
